# RSA

Java implementation for RSA algorithm. Including: Encryption, Decryption, Mathematical attack and Chosen Ciphertext attack. Along with some graphs for Encryption time against Key size and Crack time for Mathematical attack against Key size.

For building most files a simple javac followed by java is sufficient. For graphs, linking to javafx is required.
